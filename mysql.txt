Here’s how you can install **MySQL Server** and **DBeaver** on a **Linux system (Ubuntu/Debian-based)**. Let me know if you're using a different distro like Fedora, Arch, etc.

### **1. Install MySQL Server**

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
```

Once installed, secure the installation:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Follow the prompts to set root password and secure your setup.

To check MySQL status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

To start MySQL if it’s not running:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

### **2. Install DBeaver (Community Edition)**

Option 1: **Install via `.deb` package**

```bash
wget https://dbeaver.io/files/dbeaver-ce_latest_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./dbeaver-ce_latest_amd64.deb
```

Option 2: **Install via Snap (if available)**

```bash
sudo snap install dbeaver-ce
```

---

### **3. Launch DBeaver**

You can launch it from the application menu or via terminal:

```bash
dbeaver
```

From there, you can connect to MySQL using:

* Host: `localhost`
* Port: `3306`
* User: `root` (or other)
* Password: (whatever you set)
