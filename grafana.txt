Perfect! Since you want to **install Grafana directly (not Docker)** and make it **publicly accessible** (e.g., from your React app via an iframe), here’s a complete step-by-step guide:

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step to Install and Make Grafana Publicly Accessible

### ⚙️ 1. **Install Grafana (Direct Installation)**

For **Ubuntu/Debian**:

```bash
# Add Grafana APT repo
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

# Install Grafana
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grafana

# Start and enable the service
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
```

Now open:
➡️ `http://localhost:3000`
Login: `admin / admin`

### 🌐 2. **Expose Grafana Publicly (Access from Internet or LAN)**

#### 🧱 If You Want LAN Access:

* Get your local IP:

  ```bash
  ip a  # or ifconfig
  ```
* Access Grafana at: `http://<your-local-ip>:3000`

#### 🌐 If You Want Internet Access:

* You need to **open port 3000** in your firewall:

  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp
  ```

* If hosted on cloud (e.g., AWS/GCP), also open port 3000 in your VM's security group.

* Optional but safer: Use **Nginx + domain + HTTPS** (ask if you want setup instructions).

### 🔒 3. **Enable Anonymous Access (No Login Required)**

Edit config file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/grafana/grafana.ini
```

Change these lines:

```ini
[auth.anonymous]
enabled = true
org_name = Main Org.
org_role = Viewer
```

Uncomment and set:

```ini
[security]
allow_embedding = true
```

> 🔄 Restart Grafana:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
```

---

### 🧩 4. **Share Dashboard via IFrame in React App**

In Grafana UI:

* Open your dashboard.
* Click **Share → Embed**.
* Copy the `<iframe>` URL (something like `http://<your-ip>:3000/d/abcd123/dashboard-name?orgId=1&kiosk`).

In your React component:

```jsx
<iframe
  src="http://<your-ip>:3000/d/abcd123/my-dashboard?orgId=1&kiosk"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  frameBorder="0"
/>
```

---

### 🧪 Test:

1. Open your React app → see the embedded dashboard.
2. Try opening the iframe URL in an **incognito window** → should load without login.

---

### 🔐 Bonus Tip (Security)

To protect from abuse if you go public:

* Run behind Nginx and restrict by domain/IP.
* Set up HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt.
* Use CORS settings if needed for React app.

---

Let me know:

* What OS are you using?
* Are you hosting locally or on a cloud server?
* Do you want to expose to LAN only or public internet?

I’ll adjust instructions based on that.
